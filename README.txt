We describe a software framework used to perform Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) with the goal of extracting resonance information from multiparticle final states. The software is directed to photoproduction experiments using linearly polarized beams. The software can also be used to extract model parameters by comparing model and data, by performing extended likelihood fits. The framework includes a very specific realization of the Isobar model. We describe the step-by-step processes leading to a full PWA of data. We also describe the MonteCarlo approach to simulate data given a set of resonances and waves, or the production amplitudes found in a previous fit to the data. 
Most of the code is written in Python, but hybrid code (in Cython or Fortran) has been used when appropriate. The software is directed to be used at Jefferson Lab, therefore is specifically adapted to Jefferson Lab Scientific Computing resources. The goal of this software framework is to create a user friendly environment of fast executing code to make PWA easier at JLab.
