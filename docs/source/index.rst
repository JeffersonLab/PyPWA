Welcome to PyPWA's documentation!
#################################
A python based software framework designed to perform Partial Wave and
Amplitude Analysis with the goal of extracting resonance information from
multi-particle final states. Though due to the generic nature of PyPWA's design,
it should be able to be used with any statistical analysis project.

PyPWA is constantly tested to work with Python Versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
