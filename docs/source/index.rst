Partial Wave Analysis done right.

PyPWA is a Python partial wave analysis package that utilizes Numpy,
iminuit, and PyTables to provide a high speed analysis framework that
strives to help you get your work done without getting in your way.

It's a package that can be used either as a standalone program inside
your terminal, or as Python script or Jupyter Notebook, whatever your
preference may be.
