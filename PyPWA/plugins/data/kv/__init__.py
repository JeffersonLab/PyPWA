Handles EVIL to / from memory.

The objects in this file are dedicated to reading the EVIL files from disk
and into memory. This file type is being depreciated for many reasons, and
will live here until it shrivels away, is completely forgotten, and dies.

EVIL, Expanded Variable Identification Lists, earned their name from their
inefficient nature when it comes to reading in, writing out, or simply
existing, its a name given to these EVIL formats out of a mixture of spite
and love by current and former developers alike.

This format exists currently only as backwards compatibility, and may not
be bug free or entirely optimized, and may never be. If you are a user
trying to figure out what you should export your data to, or a developer
trying to learn the nature of data within PyPWA, you should move your
attention to CSV/TSV in the SV object and forget that this ever existed.
