The core libraries of PyPWA
---------------------------
Any core libraries that are needed for PyPWA that wouldn't or shouldn't
function as a plugin, are located here. This means anything whose internal
function shouldn't really change should be here, such as hash generation,
data location, and such.

- data_handler - Handles the data parsing and iteration for the entire
  package.

- interfaces - The interfaces to the program, while the configurator and
  other initializing packages may offer their own interfaces to load into
  the program. These interfaces actually define how the objects should
  interact with each other instead.

- initial_logging - Controls how logging works in PyPWA. Currently is
  limited to string logging.

- misc_file_libs - File containing a collection of functions whose focus is
  handling file data for the package. This includes hashing, locations,
  and file length.

- plugin_loader - The main plugin loading module inside PyPWA. It's generic
  enough to be used anywhere but also powerful enough to handle all plugin
  needs.
