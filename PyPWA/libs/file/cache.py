Caching
-------
Stores the data in a pickle cache. By taking advantage of SHA-512 and
python's pickle, caches can be loaded and stored rapidly, while allowing
us to automatically invalidate the cache when the source file has changed
in any way.

Both read and write support being used as an intermediate step. The
intermediate step would allow you to save your data quickly for loading
later. The resulting file would only be readable in Python. This method
is very fast.

    by providing a name and setting intermediate to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : Path or str

        The first value in the tuple is whether the cache is valid or not
